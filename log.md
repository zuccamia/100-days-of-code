# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Moved my terminal cookbook app to Sinatra framework. I built an app that allows me to store, create, edit, remove and import from the internet a recipe using the  MVC model as part of Le Wagon coding bootcamp class.

**Thoughts:** It was really cool getting to know how to transform the `gets` and `put`' of `view` into html files and how html can interact with the database (in my case, a csv file) with `params`. I still, however, struggle to understand the underwork of http calls. For example, when  I called  an erb file in my `get` block, the code broke unless I changed the variables into instance variables (prefixed with `@`). I also ran into the same problem with Nokogiri and searching inside a html doc when running an app on a server, as I did with my [LINE chat bot](https://github.com/zuccamia/veg-dinner-linechat-bot).

**Link to work:** Unavailable as the repository is private to the bootcamp organization.
