# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Moved my terminal cookbook app to Sinatra framework. I built an app that allows me to store, create, edit, remove and import from the internet a recipe using the  MVC model as part of Le Wagon coding bootcamp class.

**Thoughts:** It was really cool getting to know how to transform the `gets` and `put`' of `view` into html files and how html can interact with the database (in my case, a csv file) with `params`. I still, however, struggle to understand the underwork of http calls. For example, when  I called  an erb file in my `get` block, the code broke unless I changed the variables into instance variables (prefixed with `@`). I also ran into the same problem with Nokogiri and searching inside a html doc when running an app on a server, as I did with my [LINE chat bot](https://github.com/zuccamia/veg-dinner-linechat-bot).

**Link to work:** Unavailable as the repository is private to the bootcamp organization.

### Day 1: November 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Set up my first project on Rails and started learning [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) for a [volunteer project](https://github.com/zuccamia/patanjalijapan-yoga-app). I have been supporting a local health and wellness organization started up by a friend whom I met at a yoga event here in Tokyo. Previously I helped put together their [website](https://www.patanjali.jp/) and am now maintaining it.

**Thoughts:** I had some issues installing and kicking off Bulma (some `deprecated warnings` with `npm` and `errors` loading `binding.gyp` file) which I have no idea of...Guess I need to take some time to understand the basics of dependencies in software, node and npm. On a side note, after hours running into errors due to misspelling of multiple models, controllers, views files to build a terminal app in Ruby, working on Rails felt like independence day!!

### Day 2: November 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Read about Cron job and got to know that Heroku has free scheduler add-on that I can use for my volunteer project app. I also learned how to use SQLite today in the bootcamp class, had fun solving the challenges for querying.

**Thoughts:** Deep work matters. It took me a while to pick up the problem from last night after spending a few hours on the unrelated tasks in my current recruitment job.

**Link to work:** Same as Day 1.
